Horse
=====

Sample Ruby program

This program reads a file containing a list of horse heigths and weights. It then calculates the mean height and weight of the horses in the list. 
After that, it calculates the standard deviations of the heights and weights of the horses in the list. 

It them loads a list of stables and stores them as seperate classes. 

You can then enter your horse's height, weight, and the ID if the stable at which you keep your horse. If your stable is in the list, its name is printed. Otherwise, "Other Stable" is printed. 

Then it compares your horse's height and weight to the mean of the other horses and tells you if your horse's height or weight is more than a standard deviation above or below the mean, or if your animal is possibly a giraffe.
